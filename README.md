# **MineSweeper**

MineSweeper is a Python terminal project. This project runs in the Code Institute mock terminal provided by Heroku.

## **Rules of the game**
The aim of the game is to locate 5 flags located randomly on the grid. This is done using a coordinate system. If the user locates all 5 flags successfully, they will recieve a win message from the terminal. However, if the user inputs the coordinates for a mine, they lose. Once the game is over, users are given the option to restart. 

## **Features**


-   Terminal prints out welcome message
